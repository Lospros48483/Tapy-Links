Make it as cool as you want. You need to have python installed and you will be all set! There are coments to help you how to change some thing but if you don't know something put an issue and i will help you! You can also creat a .exe or .app file!

for MacOS or Windows:
  1.if you don't have pyinstaller, Then use "pip install pyinstaller" to install it in the terminal.
  2.Navigate to where the file is and open it in windows with the terminal.
  3.Then do this command "pyinstaller --onefile -w 'filename.py'"
  4.Go to the folder and delet build and the name of the file .spec
  5.Open dist and then you have the .exe or .app dipending on the opereation system.

Also! if you edit the .py file you will need to do the steps to it to work again! And the MacOS file only works in Macos it shows like a folder but when you dowloded it. it will be an app!
You can use it in other python proyects. Thanks!
